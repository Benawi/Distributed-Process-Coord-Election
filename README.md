# How to use GitHub flow

## Main branch

You can think about the `main` branch as a snapshot of your application that at any moment can be used for:
- deployment to production (which often occurs automatically) - you do not want to deploy broken code by accident.
- developing new features with multiple collaborators - your teammates need a stable version of your project to start implementing changes.

Therefore the `main` branch should always be stable code that actually works and can be safely used. Any changes required in the application should be introduced in `feature` branches and approved before merging them to the `main` branch.

*NOTE: The `main` branch is a rather new name. Previously it was called the `master` branch. GitHub [has changed it for good reasons](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/github-to-replace-master-with-main-starting-in-october-what-developers-need-to-know/), but you can still see some references to the `master` in many articles. Do not let that confuse you.*

## Feature branches

Before you start working on a new feature, you should create a new `feature` branch that is based on the `main` branch. You will use this branch for all your work.
In order to get a deeper understanding of `feature` branches

Remember that your branch name should be descriptive (e.g.: `refactor-authentication`, `user-content-cache-key`, `make-retina-avatars`), so that others can see what is being worked on.

## Opening pull requests

Once you start working on any project, initialize its `main` branch. Then, add changes in a `feature` branch(es).
You will need to create a *pull request* to compare your `feature` branch with the `main` branch and submit the link to that pull request via your Dashboard.
After you submit the link to your pull request you will get a code review from one of our code reviewers. 

You should not merge your pull requests to the `main` branch of your project without a code review that *approves* your changes.
